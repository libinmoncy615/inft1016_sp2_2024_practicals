Assignmen 2 WebPage
Step1 - Successfully created a repository and created folder with name as Assignmet_2_webpage and added the necessary collaborators 
Step2 - For the web page elements I have added a page called second_page which basically consists of the subject which I have learned during my smester, and for the home page comprises of short history and future of studying at UniSA
To do this there was a navigation button which I had inserted in my code so that when he user clicks the necessary button the required page gets generated.
Step3 - Later on I had also added buttons by adding necessary images about UniSA, so basically this function is applied when the user clicks the change theme button the image also changes.
Step4- Later on I had also used Toggle theme mechanism by placing a button which basically converts dark theme to light theme and vice versa for the users comfort.

For all these steps to work I have created two additional files which are base.css and script.jss files. The base.css files basically comprises of the font and type of colours used for the fonts and buttons and headings and the script.jss files comprises of two functions which are change image and toggle theme.


Install VS studio and later on I have linked GitHub and VS studio and then using Command Prompt I have configured VS studio using my Git Hub credentials.
