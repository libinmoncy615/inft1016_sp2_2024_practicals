        <h2>History and Future</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The forerunners of todayâ€™s UniSA were the South Australian School of Art, founded in 1856, the first of several Teacher Training Colleges formed in 1876, and the School of Mines and Industries which was established in 1889. 
                These schools were renowned for providing quality education and for responding to the needs of the nascent colony of South Australia.
            <li>A faculty structure was adopted in 1992, and in 1993 UniSA established the Australian Technology Network (ATN) with the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Curtin University of Technology in Perth, RMIT University in Melbourne and the University of Technology, Sydney.</li>
            <li>UniSA offers a dynamic and agile culture, one that embraces challenges and thrives on breaking new ground. Our breadth of activity provides our employees with a wide range of opportunities to grow and pursue new directions in a vibrant, engaging environment that goes beyond traditional limitations.
                Our employees are motivated by seeing our graduates as the new professionals driving the national and international agenda through the skills and capabilities they have developed during their studies at UniSA.</li>
